# ETL Architecture for SQL Database

I developed this code for the WildePod project as a **Software Engineer** volunteer. You can learn more about WildePod [here](https://wildepod.org).

While the code itself may not be directly applicable outside the context of WildePod, it provides valuable insights for developing an effective **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process for a **SQL database**, specifically for **Postgres** in this case.

To better understand the **ETL Architecture**, please refer to my gist [here](https://gist.github.com/robson-koji/abb5b79277a896763147a6909f78ce6f)
